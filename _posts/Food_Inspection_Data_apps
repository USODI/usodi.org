When we go out to eat, we assume that the resturants we eat at are clean, safe, and healthy. In order to make sure that resturants are maintaining safe practicies, local governments all across the county inspect them on a regular basis. 

However, the health rating of a resturant isn't always displayed out in the open. And when it is, it doesn't always give you detailed information about the inspection. Did it have any faults? Were they serious? What makes something an "A" or "Pass" rating versus a "C" or "Fail" rating? 

Across the country, cities like [San Fransisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Health/Restaurant-Scores/stya-26eb), [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5), [New York](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck), and [Boston](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Health/Food-Establishment-Inspections/qndu-wx8w) are making this data available in bulk format. 

The issue is that it's not always easy for consumer to find this information out - particularly when they're out and about trying to find a place to eat. Thankfully, there are a few apps available that are taking this information and using it to help consumers make informed decisions. 

## HDScores

HDscores is an upcoming app for the iOS and Android systems that will let users get information on health inspections at nearby resturants. The most impressive thing about the HDscores app is that the app gathers bulk health inspection data from across the country. Currently, the HDscores app pulls data from 530,000 establishments and has access to over three million inspection reports.

The app uses a series of robots to find the data an import it into the HDscores app data base. To do this, the developers use a variety of methods including xpath, xmath, and regular expressions to build a custom program based on the jurisdiction. This allows the team to get data regardless of the system being used. They currently import data from older CSV and Flash systems, to new ones using the new LIVES standard. 

The app will first focus on the consumer market. Currently in private alpha, the app helps users find resturant inspection data using their phones. When you open the app, it will give you the option to either search for an establishment name or check out establishments near you. Clicking on a location will give you information about the resturant's inspection history. Clicking on the each inspection will give you detailed information including violations, the notes from the inspector, and if any of the violations were critical. The app also allows you to save your favorite resturants for easier access. 

Eventually, the team would also like to cater to both governments and buisnesses. Because they have access to data from multiple cities, the team feels they could provide valuable predictive analytics tools to local health departments. Additionally, because they're gathing information from health departments as soon as their updating they can also provide buisness referall services. 

For example, if a health inspector finds roaches at a restuarant and places it in the report. HDscores would then send a message to pest control clients letting them know, allowing the pest control buisness to make a potential sale. 

The HDscores iOS will launch ad free in mid-August with the Android app launching this fall. To find out more information you can visit their website at [http://hdscores.com/](http://hdscores.com/). 

## Openhealthinspection.com

[OpenHealthInspection.com](http://openhealthinspection.com/#/) is a web app that shows health inspection data around the Hampton Roads, Virgina area. The app was built by the [Code for America Hampton Roads Brigade](http://codeforhamptonroads.org/).

When you open the app, it brings you to a searchable map of all nearby resturants. The app also gives you a list of nearby establishments to the right of the screen. When you click a restuarant, it gives you detailed information about the last few inspections. The app also uses helpful icons to distinguish between critial violations, repeat violations, or violations that were corrected during the inspection. 

The site is also designed responsivly and can use the GPS on the user's mobile device to find establishments near the user.  
The app is open source and can be found on the [Code for Hampton Roads Github page](https://github.com/c4hrva/open-health-inspection-app).
